# tic-tac-toe
We Aspire to create a tic-tac-toe game as a project for AMOC. We plan to make the game playable in two modes:
We, under AMOC 2019 organized by ACM-NIT Surat, present you a C++ code which works as a Tic-Tac-Toe game that users can enjoy in two modes:
(I)	Vs COM
(II)	Vs User
The great thing about the Vs User mode that we have created is that it is impossible to win it. If a user plays perfectly, the result would come out as a draw. So, there are two outcomes of the game, either a Draw or a Lose!
In Vs User mode, we can easily play with our friends and apply our playing skills.
